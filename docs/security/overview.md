# Security Overview

## Introduction
This document outlines the security architecture, policies, and practices implemented in GAIAthon25-Hub to protect user data, ensure system integrity, and maintain compliance with security standards.

## Security Architecture

### Authentication & Authorization
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**
  - Required for all users
  - Supports TOTP, email, and SMS methods
  - 7-day grace period for setup after account creation

- **Password Policy**
  - Minimum 12 characters
  - Must include uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
  - Maximum age: 90 days
  - Previous 5 passwords cannot be reused
  - Secure password hashing using bcrypt

- **Session Management**
  - JWT-based authentication
  - 24-hour session duration
  - Automatic extension on activity
  - Maximum 5 concurrent sessions
  - Secure session storage with httpOnly cookies

### Data Protection

#### Data at Rest
- **Encryption**
  - AES-256-GCM encryption for sensitive data
  - 90-day key rotation policy
  - Secure key management using environment variables

- **Database Security**
  - MongoDB Atlas with network isolation
  - SSL/TLS encryption for all connections
  - Regular security patches and updates
  - Automated backups with encryption

#### Data in Transit
- **Transport Security**
  - TLS 1.3 required for all connections
  - Strong cipher suites:
    - TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384
    - TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256
  - HSTS enabled with preloading
  - Certificate pinning for API endpoints

### Access Control
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
  - Predefined roles: admin, manager, member, guest
  - Granular permissions system
  - Regular access review (90-day cycle)
  - Principle of least privilege

- **API Security**
  - Rate limiting (100 requests per 15 minutes)
  - Request validation using Zod
  - API key rotation
  - Input sanitization

### Security Headers
- **Content Security Policy (CSP)**
  ```
  default-src 'self';
  script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://cdn.vercel-insights.com;
  style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';
  img-src 'self' https: data: blob:;
  font-src 'self';
  connect-src 'self' https://vitals.vercel-insights.com https://*.sentry.io https://*.datadog.com;
  frame-src 'none';
  object-src 'none';
  base-uri 'self';
  form-action 'self';
  frame-ancestors 'none';
  ```

- **Additional Headers**
  - X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  - X-Frame-Options: DENY
  - X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  - Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### Monitoring & Auditing

#### Security Monitoring
- Real-time threat detection
- Automated security checks
- Performance monitoring with Datadog
- Error tracking with Sentry

#### Audit Logging
- Comprehensive event logging
  - Authentication events
  - Data access/modification
  - Administrative actions
- Retention periods:
  - Auth logs: 90 days
  - Activity logs: 365 days
  - Error logs: 30 days
  - Audit reports: 730 days

### Incident Response
1. **Detection & Analysis**
   - Automated threat detection
   - Log analysis
   - User reports

2. **Containment**
   - Account suspension
   - API rate limiting
   - Network isolation

3. **Eradication & Recovery**
   - Vulnerability patching
   - System restoration
   - Data recovery

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Root cause analysis
   - Security improvements
   - Documentation updates
